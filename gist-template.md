# Regular Expression Components

Regular expressions, also known as regex, are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They are commonly used in text processing and pattern matching. In this README, we will discuss the various components that make up regular expressions.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components
Regular expressions, also known as regex, are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They are commonly used in text processing and pattern matching. In this README, we will discuss the various components that make up regular expressions.

### Anchors
Anchors are used to specify the position of a match in a string. They are denoted by the caret (^) and dollar sign ($). Here are some examples of anchors:

    ^ (caret): matches the beginning of a string
    $ (dollar sign): matches the end of a string

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are used to specify how many times a character or group should be matched. They are denoted by curly braces { }. Here are some examples of quantifiers:

    {n}: matches the preceding character n times
    {n,}: matches the preceding character at least n times
    {n,m}: matches the preceding character between n and m times

### OR Operator

### Character Classes

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping is a feature in regular expressions that allows you to group multiple characters or patterns together and treat them as a single unit. Grouping is done by enclosing the characters or patterns in parentheses ( and ). Capturing is a feature in regular expressions that allows you to extract specific parts of a matched string. Capturing is done by enclosing the part of the regular expression you want to capture in parentheses ( and ).

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
